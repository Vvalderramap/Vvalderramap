- 👋 Hi, I’m @Vvalderramap
- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis. I have a passion for transforming raw data into meaningful insights that can drive business decisions and improve processes. I enjoy working with large datasets and finding patterns that others might miss.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python. I'm focused on honing my skills in data manipulation, statistical analysis, and machine learning to enhance my ability to extract and communicate valuable insights from data.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects. I believe in the power of community-driven development and I'm eager to contribute to projects where I can apply my data analysis skills and also learn from others.
